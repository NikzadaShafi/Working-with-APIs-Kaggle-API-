# Working-with-APIs-Kaggle-API
In this short code our goal is to download dataset from Kaggle website to our Google Colab or any other noterbook using API.

The Kaggle API allows you to programmatically access and interact with Kaggle datasets, kernels, competitions, and more. Here are the steps to use the Kaggle API:
1) Install the Kaggle API: To install the Kaggle API, you can use pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
2) Create a Kaggle API token: To use the Kaggle API, you need to have an API token. To create an API token, go to your Kaggle account settings page, scroll down to the "API" section, and click "Create New API Token". This will download a file named kaggle.json to your local machine.
3) Upload your Kaggle API token: After downloading the kaggle.json file, you need to upload it to the location where the Kaggle API expects it to be.
4) After uploading the file you can run the code. The kaggle.json file will be moved to root directory.
